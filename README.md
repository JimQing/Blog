## Architect theme

## Getting Started
To install this theme, jekyll is required to be installed on your system. Head over to the [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and install the four requirements (Ruby, RubyGems, Node.js and Python 2.7). If you're on a Mac system, it's likely the only package you'll need to install is Node.js

Once you've installed the requirements, run this command in your terminal:

```
$ sudo gem install jekyll
```

You'll also need to install the bundler package:

```
$ sudo gem install bundler
```

Download theme and install the dependencies

```
$ bundle install
```

Use it!

```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve -w
```

Use for production!

```
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```
